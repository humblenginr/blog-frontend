# How to Speak

Each individual's social success will be determined by his:
1. Ability to speak
2. Ability to write
3. Quality of his ideas

## How to start a talk?
Some people think it is with a [[Joke]] , but Patrick does not recommend it.
Why not start with a Joke? Because, when you start a talk, people are just getting adjusted to your vocal and speaking paramaters, and so the joke won't just sell.

Instead, he recommends that we start with the [[Empowerment Promise]]. This is basically answering the question of 'how am I going to be empowered after I listen to you?', 'why should I pay attention to you?'

## Shaping a Talk
Now Patrick goes on to give some heuristics of some samples as to how to shape a talk:
1. [[Cycles]]
	- Keep cycling around the subject. This is because people get occasionally fogged out, and this increases the probability of your content reaching more people
2. [[Building a fence around my idea]]
	- Distinctly differentiating how my idea is different from someone else's idea
3. [[Verbal Punctuation]]
	- Because people are going to be occasionally fogged out, there needs to be a landmark where we announce that this is a good time to get back on track. For instance, if we are giving a talk and it is structured, like we have 4 main topics, each having further divisions, we can announce after completing one small subdivision that it is complete by giving a short summary of it and before moving on to the next topic.
 
4. [[Asking Questions]]
	 - This is another thing that might help the audience get back on the bus
	 - Patrick also says that the question should not be too obvious that the students are embarrassed to answer and it should not also be too hard that they do not know, it should be in the middle. He says that on an average, we can wait for **7 seconds** for an answer

Along with these things, I think making a small [[Joke]] or a short interaction with the audience will also be useful in getting the audience *back in the bus*. 

Another observation that I made while listening to Patrick is that, he uses [[stories to communicate]]. Very often, he brings any past experience that he had that is of relevance to the talk, and end it in a way that relates to what he is talking about, and at the same time, sometimes he uses a [[Joke]] to end it. 

## Time and Place

One side note here as I am listening to the talk here is that, at this point, Patrick asks 'what is the best time and place for this lecture?'. Now we can see that he is asking this question to keep the audience in the bus, and also the question is carefully crafted such that it *makes the audience think*.

Patrick answers the question by saying that the best time for the lecture is 11 AM and the place has to be well lit. This is something that depends on the target audience. This is a subjective thing and therefore we have to assess and analyse what would be the best time and place for the kind of talk you are giving.

## Boards, Props and Slides

Chalks and boards are the right tools for you when your purpose is *informing*, whereas the slides might be good when your purpose is *exposing*.

Why we use a board:
1. We have a graphic quality
2. Speed
	- the speed in which we write on the board is approximately the speed in which people can absorb ideas

Using Props also help the audience engage with us more. Bringing some physical things that we can show that are related to the topic of discussion will go a great way.

Patrick says that the reason why the Props and Boards are very effective is because of something called [[Empathetic Mirroring]], which basically means that when we see the lecturer write on a board or use a prop, we tend to put ourselves in the situation and it helps in grasping whatever is being shared.

Slides should only be used as a way to expose ideas. Winston (I think I have been addressing him wrongly as Patrick) says that,
1. A slide should have very less words
2. You should not be reading the slides, because obviously the audience know how to read
3. A slide should be focusing on the images and should be clutter free
4. The images should be kept simple, otherwise it would be going against the purpose of using a slide.
5. Eliminate clutter
	- Remove the title 
		Because you are already going to tell them what the title of the slide is
	- Remove the logos
		 Because they simply aren't needed

Essentially a slide should help the audience to think about something rather than just to provide some information. But there can also be some cases where we might just wanna use the slides for the sake of showing some statistics. Those may be some exceptions. But generally, *slides should motivate the audience to think*.


## How to inspire people

Winston goes on to say that the best way to inspire people is by [[Exhibiting Passion]]. I have experienced this personally as well. I have seen some of my professors very passionate about what they are teaching and that inspired me to study the subject. 

## Job Talks

This is basically interview situations. We have 5 mins and we have to prove that we are the right candidate for the job. Most of the time, what the hiring people expect are *Vision* and *proof that you have done something*. Vision in this case is a problem statement that a lot of people care about and what your approach is towards solving that problem. It also involves *how your approach is different from the others and how is it going to work?*.


## How to Stop

Winston says that putting up a **collaborators:...** slide is not good because it is something that has to be shown on the first slide itself.
Winston says that putting up a **questions?** slide is very bad because it squanders an opportunity to tell who you are. 
He says that a better way to end a talk is by showing a **Contributions** slide. This slide should contain *what I have done*. This can be slide showing how you are contributing to the society.

Winston does not recommend saying *thank you* at the end of a talk because it gives the feeling that the audience have been sitting there listening to you out of politenes. 
We can use a [[Joke]] . there's nothing bad with it. An even better one is using something like an *anectode*. Winston shows a video where some political people end their talks with 'God bless america'.. So we could use some anectodes that make sense to the topic of the talk that happened. 
Another good way of ending a talk is by *saluting the audience*. like saying 'It's been fun being here at MIT and it has been inspiring for me to see this many people interested in things like this. I salute you for that.'
