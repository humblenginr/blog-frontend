# Why blogging?
This is a question I had asked myself a huge number of times. 
I have never come up with a convincing answer. I do not want to write blogs just for the sake of writing it.
<br/>
I knew that if I am writing some blog, then it should actually have some content in it.
<br />  
Although I was working on cool things, I have never written a blog because I could never get myself to sit for 3 hours and write about what I am working on.  
<br />  
But recently, I started following this idea of 'write to think'. If I am doing some research, I write down my insights, findings and my understandings. If I am developing some tool or a system, or coding, I write down the process. This writing helps me think clearly. 
<br />  
As writing has become an integral part of what I am doing, I thought, why not share these things I am writing? 

### Hence my blog!
