# Authenticating to EAP-PEAP Wifi using nmcli 

This is not a detailed blog post about the EAP-PEAP authentication mechanism. This is a reference note that I use when I want to connect to an EAP-PEAP wifi network. 

For an enterprise network configured with EAP-PEAP, the authentication process is different from the usual authentication mechanisms. To configure such a network using [nmcli](https://man.archlinux.org/man/nmcli.1.en),

Step 1:
Use nmcli to create a connection

```
nmcli con add type wifi ifname IFNAME con-name CONNECTION_NAME ssid SSID
```

- IFNAME should be your wifi interface name (It can be found using `ifconfig`)
- CONNECTION_NAME can be anything

Step 2:
Edit the connection and configure it to authenticate using EAP-PEAP

```
nmcli con edit id CONNECTION_NAME
nmcli> set 802-1x.eap peap
nmcli> set 802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2
nmcli> set 802-1x.identity USERNAME
nmcli> set 802-1x.password PASSWORD
nmcli> set wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap
nmcli> save
nmcli> activate
```
